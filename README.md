The goal is to use synthetic spectroscopic binary spectra to see how well we can recover radial velocities and vsini.

* Given a flux ratio, a pair of PHOENIX spectra, a set of observation times, an a binary orbit (e=0 for now), we will use the broadening function (BF) technique to investigate how well we can recover individual radial velocity measurements, the semiamplitude K, and each star's rotational velocity vsini.
